feed.html
This file can be used generally by passing 3 parameters into the genFeed method
parameters:
	regionID -the id of the region you want to display smell reports from
	elemID	 -the id of the html element that the feed should be displayed in
	path	 -the path to the images this program needs (the colored triangles)
If this functionality does not suffice there are several variables that can be changed
	updateDelay (line 21) how frequently in milliseconds the smell PGH data base is queried for new reports
	wid (line 22) a string for the width of the feed. As a string it includes both a number and units
	hi (line 23) a string for the width of the feed should be both a number and units

Wind.html
Used by passing four parameters into the getWindData function
will pass an array of near by station objects. A station object is formatted as follows:
~~~~~~~
Name:string (meaning full location name)
Station:string (a four letter code)
Location: Array(2) (latLng location of the sensor as an array)
 0:latitude
 1:longitude
windDirectionDegrees:number (wind direction in degrees)
windSpeedMPH:number (wind speed in miles per hour)
~~~~~~~
parameters:
	lat -the latitude of a point that you want sensors near as a number
	lng -the longitude of a point that you want sensors near as a number
	limit -the maximum number of miles away from the above LatLng point that a sensor can be to be included
	callBack -a function that the array of station objects will be passed into
Other variables that change functionality:
	remove0 -Boolean whether or not sensors that say wind speed and direction are both zero
		 by default is false so sensors with both values as zero are included
